# Cybersecurity Attack Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset of cybersecurity attacks. We explored patterns in protocol usage, threat severity, system responses, and yearly trends.

## Questions Explored:
- What are the most commonly used attack protocols?
- How severe are most of the attacks?
- What actions are most commonly taken by the system?
- How have attack frequencies changed over the years?

## Findings:
- ICMP, UDP, and TCP are the most frequently used protocols.
- Most attacks are labeled as “Low” severity.
- "Blocked" was the most frequent system response.
- There has been a noticeable fluctuation in attack frequency across different years.

## How to Run the Notebook:
1. Clone the GitHub repository.
2. Make sure `cybersecurity_attacks.csv` is in the same directory as `cyber_project.ipynb`.
3. Open the notebook using Jupyter or VS Code.
4. Run all cells in order.
